### Druidism Website

Its a website to simply advertise and inform attracted people about Druidism. It will contain landing page about features,
development blog, FAQ section, press kit and maybe more...

### What is Druidism?

Druidism is a video game that im working on by only myself, i make everything for it. Starting from programming all the
features to making sounds/music and even all the graphics. Ive spend thousunds of hours on learning these thing (mostly programming tho) to make this project happen. Game is kinda big scope for a single person... The inspiration for this project was that i wanted to create something unique, something that is not a classic to-do-list app, or another calculator like stuff.

### How the website is made

The website is made using Next.js and Sanity.io + Sanity Studio to make it work. I will also use Vercel(Next.js creators)
to distribute it so we will get a clean Vercel + Sanity combination to make it work. The website is also made 100% by me, like everything in this project, because im a lone wolf, and i like to do stuff by myself...

### How to use?

If you want to use this project to test something or look up how it works you must have Sanity Studio configured and get the following data to fetch from:
